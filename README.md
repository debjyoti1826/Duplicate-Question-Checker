# Abstract : 
This NLP project aims to predict whether two given questions are duplicates using Random Forest classifiers. It utilizes the Quora Question Pairs dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs
). Due to the large size of the dataset, a random sample of 30,000 question pairs was used for training. The data underwent preprocessing and feature engineering, including the addition of important new features using the fuzzywuzzy library. Each feature was visualized to understand its relationship with the prediction target. Both Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers were trained, achieving accuracies of 78.8% and 79.4%, respectively. However, the Random Forest classifier was preferred because its confusion matrix provided more reliable predictions. Finally, the solution was deployed as a web application using Streamlit.
